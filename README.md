# Agentic README Service

A service that automatically generates high-quality, AI-friendly README files for npm libraries that lack proper documentation.

## Overview

Agentic README Service analyzes npm libraries by:
1. Reading source code and existing documentation
2. Generating comprehensive, structured README files following best practices
3. Verifying assumptions through sandbox testing
4. Providing versioned, accurate documentation

The service is available as both:
- A web interface for human users
- A Model Context Protocol server for AI consumption

## Features

- **Automated Documentation Generation**: Create high-quality READMEs for any npm package
- **Sandbox Verification**: Test-driven validation of documentation claims
- **Version-Specific Documentation**: Documentation tailored to specific package versions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Continuous improvement of documentation quality
- **AI and Human Friendly**: Optimized for both human developers and AI coding assistants

## Development Status

This project is currently in development. See [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) for the roadmap and development phases.
